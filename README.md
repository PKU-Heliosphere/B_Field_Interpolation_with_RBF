# B_Field_Interpolation_with_RBF

This code collection demonstrates how to adopt the user-defined radial-basis function to interpolate the magnetic field vectors. 
One advantage of this interpolation method with RBF is that it can guarantee the divergence-free condition of the interpolated magnetic field vector.

I hope you can enjoy employing this code collection in your research work.
