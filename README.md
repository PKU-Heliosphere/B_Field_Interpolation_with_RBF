# B_Field_Interpolation_with_RBF

This code collection demonstrates how to adopt the user-defined radial-basis function to interpolate the magnetic field vectors. 
One advantage of this interpolation method with RBF is that it can guarantee the divergence-free condition of the interpolated magnetic field vector.

On how to use it:
Put RBF_B.py and Verify_RBF_B_function.py into one directory.
And just run Verify_RBF_B_function.py directly.

I hope you can enjoy employing this code collection in your research work.
